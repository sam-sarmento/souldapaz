I want to bathe in the Ganges waters
I want to dive in Jordan river
Quench my thirst at the Zanzan well
Yes! I want to see
The stream that flows from Himalaia
And the scented water of the Il� Aiy�

Hey..... 2x

The water that flows from the rock
Yes, I want to see it too
And when the Red Sea opens wide
I want to cross it with you

Hey... 2x

Every water that falls from the sky
Tastes as honey         2x
And if every seed needs water to germinate     2x
Now I want more
Seeds of peace           2x

Hey... 2x

The water that flows from the rock
Yes, I want to see it too
And when the Red Sea opens wide
I want to cross it with you

Hey... 2x

Every water that falls from the sky
Tastes as honey 2x

Hey... 2x
