Car, subway, motorcycle
Bus, sidewalk, bicycle
With your heart, reach out, the citizen is a brother!

Anyone which is the skin color, social condition, religion
Be a supporter of "tricolor", "verdão", "peixe", "timão" (brazilian soccer teams) eh oh
Downtown, in the hood,
In a trap, a fairy tale
I'll go in faith, to "Sé", "Canindé", "Tatuapé" (São Paulo's neighbourhoods)
"Consolação" or "Capão", "Pinheiros", "Parelheiros" (very uneven neighbourhoods in São Paulo)
Church, synagogue, mosque or "terreiro" (umbanda temples)
I'm a warrior of peace, by instinct
I fell the hunger of the hungry

Justice to the unjusticed
To the unsheltered, a roof!
To the unemployed, a job!
Yeah! I don't give peace

The love of our neighbor is my plot
The love of our neighbor is your plot
The love of our neighbor is our plot!

For the population, unite together in action!
Oh brave nation, people of religion!                  2x

Brave heart! Awakening love in people's heart!
