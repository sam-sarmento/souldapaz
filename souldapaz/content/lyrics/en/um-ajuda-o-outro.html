A muslim, great friend of mine
Reached out to our jewish brother
Our jewish brother, who cannot say no
Whenever he can, he helps our christian brother

And the believer, helps the babalorisha friend of us. 2x

The babalorisha and the baptist preacher
Lend a helping hand to our buddhist brother
Our buddhist brother, who wants to heal the planet
Helped the hindu, hare krishna hare
The hare krishna helps other friends of mine
Completely agnostics, completely atheists

And the believer, helps the babalorisha friend of us. 2x

And that's how the networks of the good are formed
The shaman helps the shintoist
The kardecist helps the mormon
One helps the other, the other helps the one
Perfect Liberty followers, or (Rev. Moon) unificationist members

And the believer, helps the babalorisha friend of us. 2x
